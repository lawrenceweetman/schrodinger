My repo for Schrodinger's Java elements.

## Schrodinger's Boolean
Provided is a new type, "SchrodingerBoolean". Unlike Java's Boolean object, Schrodinger's Boolean will evaluate to both TRUE and FALSE when first initialised, and will only evaluate correctly once it has been explicitly set to either TRUE or FALSE by the developer.
